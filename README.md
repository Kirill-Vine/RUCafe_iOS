# RUCafe_iOS
RU Cafe project created for iOS using Swift and Xcode
In this project, I developed an iOS application for a cafe that sells donuts and coffee. This is 
a clone of the Android app that I made earlier with some improvements to the UI. Original Android app
can be found here https://github.com/Kirill-Vine/RUCafe/tree/master
The application supports 2 types of users: the customer and the store owner.
The app allows customer users to select up to 5 different flavors for the coffee, 4 different sizes,
and up to 5 cups of a particular size and flavor and add to the cart. Each configuration affects
the price of the coffee or multiple coffees. The customer also has the option to choose between
18 different donuts to add to their shopping cart, all of which have a different price depending on
the type of donut. In both coffee and donut menus, the current subtotal updates are in real-time.
When the customer is finished, he or she may navigate to their shopping cart to review their
items and total including tax. They remove items they do not want and then purchase the order.
When the order is purchased it is pushed to the Store Orders tab where all customer orders are
displayed with all items, their prices and quantity, and the orderâ€™s total displayed. The owner
user has the option to cancel the selected order to remove it from the list, once the order is
served. Run on iPhone 14 Pro
